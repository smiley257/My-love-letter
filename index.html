    <h1>Dear Pranav 💌</h1>
    <p>
      I feel the happiest when I'm with you and so I would love to do anything and go out of my way to see that perfect beautiful smile of yours.<br><br>
      Today, I told the stars about you and I figured that the stars would be so proud that their atoms made someone like you.<br><br>
      In this world, there's black and there's white. While grey is in between them.<br>
      But if you ask me, there's death and there's life. But what lies between them are those beautiful black eyes of yours.<br><br>
      I love you to the moon n back. ❤️<br><br>
