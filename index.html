    <h2>Dear Pranav,</h2>
    <p>
      I feel the happiest when I'm with you and so I would love to do anything and go out of my way to see that perfect beautiful smile of yours.
      <br/><br/>
      Today, I told the stars about you and I figured that the stars would be so proud that their atoms made someone like you.
      <br/><br/>
      In this world, there's black and there's white. While grey is in between them.<br/>
      But if you ask me — there's death and there's life. But what lies between them are those beautiful black eyes of yours.
      <br/><br/>
      I love you to the moon n back. ❤️
    </p>
    <h3>Yours, Stuti</h3>
